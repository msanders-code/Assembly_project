# Assembly_project
Low-Level IO procedures in IA-86 Assembly language

This project prompts a user to enter 10 positive or negative integers and then finds the sum and average of those numbers. It utilizes macros, string primitives and custom procedures. It checks that actual number values have been entered and that they are within a specific range; if not a special message is output with information on the error to the user.
